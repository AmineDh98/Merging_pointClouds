# Merging_pointClouds
This Python script provides functionality for merging LiDAR point clouds obtained from positions using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The script also performs transformations, such as GPS to Cartesian conversion, camera projection, and color mapping to create a merged and colored point cloud map.
